## General Configuration

Much of a Jekyll's configuration is held in the `_config.yml` file in the project root. 

For information on general Jekyll configuration, please check out the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/){:target="_blank"}.

Below are some specific options that you might want to set in your `_config.yml` when using Bulma Clean Theme.

## Lang

The html lang attribute is set to `en` by default but you can override this in the _config.yml file `lang: en`

## Direction
The html _dir_ attribute is set to `ltr` by default. It can be overridden in the _config.yml file like `direction: rtl`. 
```

## GitHub Sponsor

If you have a GitHub sponsors account set up, you can add your username to `gh_sponsor` in the `_config.yml` file and it will display a link to your profile on the right of the navbar.

```yaml
gh_sponsor: Your Github user
```

Further information on Sponsors feature available in the [Sponsors docs page](/sponsors/).
